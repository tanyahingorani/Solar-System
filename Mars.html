        <p>Brr! Mars, also known as the red planet, is extremely cold. The average temperature on Mars is -80  degrees F. Mars is red because of rusty iron in it&#39;s soil. Mars has a pinkish
sky because of red dust in the air. Did you know the largest volcano in the solar system is on it? The volcano is called the Olympus Mon. Mars is the most likely planet to have life on it, not including Earth.
Mars used to have water, and it might still have water pockets in the ground. Wow! I would love to see Martian aliens! Mars is the fourth planet from the sun, and the last inner planet.</p>
