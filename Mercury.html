        <p> The inner planets are the first 4 planets closest to the sun, all rocky. The first inner planet is Mercury, meaning it is the closest planet to the sun. It is one of the hottest and
coldest planets in the solar system. The daylight side of Mercury experiences temperatures of about 800 degrees F. The nighttime side meanwhile experiences bitter temperatures of about
-300 degrees F. On Mercury, one year is quicker than a day! That is crazy! One year is eighty-eight earth days, and 1 day is 176 earth years.This is possible because one year is one complete
revolution around the sun. Because Mercury is so close to the sun, it has a smaller circle to complete. One day is one complete rotation. Mercury has no moon. Mercury is the smallest
planet in the solar system. Mercury is a very small planet, but it is 1.4 times larger than our moon.</p>
