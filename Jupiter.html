        <p> The outer and inner planets are separated by the asteroid belt, as mentioned in the introduction. The first outer planet is Jupiter. Jupiter is the biggest planet in the solar system.
  Also, Jupiter stinks! This planet has ammonium hydrosulfide, which smells like rotten eggs. Jupiter has 63 moons. Jupiter has 2 rings, but they are too thin to be seen from Earth.
  All seven of the other planets could fit inside Jupiter easily. Jupiter is also a gas giant. It is made of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface. Jupiter is famous for a huge earth-size hurricane called
  The Great Red Spot. Jupiter is a tremendously large planet.</p>
