        <p> When reddish colored Makemake, the third biggest dwarf planet, was discovered it was called ‘Easter bunny’, because it was found around Easter time.
Makemake is made of ice. It takes 310 earth years for Makemake to make one complete orbit around our Sun.
That means 310 earth years for one year on Makemake. </p>
