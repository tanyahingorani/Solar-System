        <p> Earth is our planet, the third planet from the sun. It is sometimes known as the blue planet because of all Earth&#39;s oceans. Earth is the only planet where all 3 forms of water
  (Liquid water, water vapor, and ice) exist. Sometimes planets that are similar to Earth are found, but slightly larger.
  These are called Super-earths. Super-earths can be found all over the universe. Our Earth is an amazing world with water
  and not many extreme temperatures. It is the perfect planet for life.</p>
