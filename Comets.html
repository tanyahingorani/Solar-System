        <p>      Comets have several parts. The nucleus is the main solid part of a comet. It is often one to ten kilometers in diameter, but can also be 100 kilometers.
      The coma is a circle of dust evaporated gas such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and more. The nucleus and the coma together make the head of the comet.
      Surrounding the coma is the hydrogen envelope, which is an invisible layer of clouds. The dust tail is made from dust and always points away from the sun. The ion tail is made
      from electrically charged gas molecules. Those are the parts of a comet. </p>
        

<p>The difference between meteors, meteoroids, meteorites, comets, and asteroids is that asteroids are made of various
metals and rocky material, while comets are made of ice, dust and rocky material. Meteoroids, meteors, and meteorites are parts of asteroids and comets.
Asteroids, comets, meteors, meteoroids, and meteorites are all different, interesting space objects.</p>

        <p>The difference between meteors, meteoroids, and meteorites;  A meteoroid is a small part from an asteroid or a comet that is orbiting the Sun.
A meteor is what a meteoroid is called when it burns up in the Earths atmosphere, and it is also known as a shooting star. A meteorite is a meteoroid that
makes it&#39;s journey through the Earths atmosphere and hits the Earths surface. That is the difference between meteors, meteoroids, and meteorites.

<p>
Meteoroids are mostly made of rock. 10% are made of iron and nickel. Did you know Earth gains almost a ton of weight from meteor dust
 everyday? Wow! The Earth must be heavy!
