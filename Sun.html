        <p> The sun is the only star you can see in the daytime. It is also the source of all light and heat. It is made up of 74% hydrogen and 25% helium.
        I wonder what the last 1% is?Do you know what sunspots are?  They are spots on the sun that are more chilly than the rest of the sun.
        But they are still blazing hot! The sun has a core that is around 27 million  degrees F. The sun has a surface that is around 10,00 degrees F.
        More than 1 million earths could fit inside the Sun. Can you believe how hot the sun is?</p>
