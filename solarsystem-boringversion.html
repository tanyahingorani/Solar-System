  <body bgcolor="#d9dff4">

        <h2>Introducion</h2>
        <p>The Solar System is a unique collection of stars and planets in our galaxy. The first 4 planets are called the inner planets. All the other planets are the outer planets.
        The inner planets are separated from the outer planets separated by the asteroid belt. Meteors, asteroids, and comets are all different things. Scroll down to learn a little about everything. </p>

<h2>The Sun</h2>
<p>
  The sun is the only star you can see in the daytime. It is also the source of all light and heat. It is made up of 74% hydrogen and 25% helium. I wonder what the last 1% is?
  Do you know what sunspots are?  They are spots on the sun that are more chilly than the rest of the sun. But they are still blazing hot! The sun has a core that is around 27 million  degrees F.
  The sun has a surface that is around 10,00 degrees F.  More than 1 million earths could fit inside the Sun. Can you believe how hot the sun is?
</p>
<h2>The Inner Planets</h2>
<p> The inner planets are the first 4 planets closest to the sun, all rocky. The first inner planet is Mercury, meaning it is the closest planet to the sun. It is one of the hottest and
coldest planets in the solar system. The daylight side of Mercury experiences temperatures of about 800 degrees F. The nighttime side meanwhile experiences bitter temperatures of about
-300 degrees F. On Mercury, one year is quicker than a day! That is crazy! One year is eighty-eight earth days, and 1 day is 176 earth years.This is possible because one year is one complete
revolution around the sun. Because Mercury is so close to the sun, it has a smaller circle to complete. One day is one complete rotation. Mercury has no moon. Mercury is the smallest
planet in the solar system. Mercury is a very small planet, but it is 1.4 times larger than our moon.
</p>
<p>
  Next up is Venus, the 2nd planet away from the sun!  Venus has clouds of dangerous sulfuric acid. The clouds trap in the heat and they also clouds act like a blanket.
  This is called the greenhouse effect. The clouds create surface temperatures of 870 degrees F. On Venus, it is so hot, liquid instantly evaporates up over there. Venus is a very interesting planet.
</p>
<p>
  Earth is our planet, the third planet from the sun. It is sometimes known as the blue planet because of all Earth&#39;s oceans. Earth is the only planet where all 3 forms of water
  (Liquid water, water vapor, and ice) exist. Sometimes planets that are similar to Earth are found, but slightly larger.
  These are called Super-earths. Super-earths can be found all over the universe. Earth has one moon. Our moon was made when a space object the size of Mars hit Earth.
  The collision caused chunks of earth break off. The debris got together and started orbiting the Earth, and was later recognized as our moon. Our Earth is an amazing world with water
  and not many extreme temperatures. It is the perfect planet for life.
</p>
<p>
Brr! Mars, also known as the red planet, is extremely cold. The average temperature on Mars is -80  degrees F. Mars is red because of rusty iron in it&#39;s soil. Mars has a pinkish
sky because of red dust in the air. Did you know the largest volcano in the solar system is on it? The volcano is called the Olympus Mon. Mars is the most likely planet to have life on it, not including Earth.
Mars used to have water, and it might still have water pockets in the ground. Wow! I would love to see Martian aliens! Mars is the fourth planet from the sun, and the last inner planet.
</p>


<h2>The Outer Planets</h2>
<p>
  The outer and inner planets are separated by the asteroid belt, as mentioned in the introduction. The first outer planet is Jupiter. Jupiter is the biggest planet in the solar system.
  Also, Jupiter stinks! This planet has ammonium hydrosulfide, which smells like rotten eggs. Jupiter has 63 moons. Jupiter has 2 rings, but they are too thin to be seen from Earth.
  All seven of the other planets could fit inside Jupiter easily. Jupiter is also a gas giant. It is made of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface. Jupiter is famous for a huge earth-size hurricane called
  The Great Red Spot. Jupiter is a tremendously large planet.
</p>
<p>
  Saturn is the sixth planet away from the sun. Saturn&#39;s rings are brighter than Saturn is itself. 1 year on Saturn is 29.5 years on Earth. Saturn, like Jupiter, is a gas giant. If there was a pool big
  enough, Saturn could float in the water. Let&#39;s hope it doesn&#39;t lose any rings! Saturn has 17 known moons. One of Saturns moons is Titan. Titan has huge lakes of crude oil. Titan also has seasonal changes and
  light rain. The atmosphere on Titan is nearly the same as Earth&#39;s atmosphere was 4 billion years ago. Saturn is beautiful, with a moon that may be populated with humans in the future.
</p>
<p>
  Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun. Uranus has 10 rings. Uranus has a 98 degree tilt to the side, and it&#39;s rings do too, so Uranus looks upside down. Uranus has 27 known moons.
  Uranus has a north pole that experiences 42 years of darkness, followed by 42 years of brightness. It is the same with the south pole. Uranus is also a gas giant. Uranus is 8 times the size of Earth.
  Uranus is big, but not as big as Jupiter. Uranus is one tipped over planet!
</p>
<p>
  Neptune is the farthest planet from the sun. It is also the smallest gas giant. Neptune is extremely cold. The temperature at the top of the layer of clouds can be -350 degrees F, yet Neptune&#39;s core
  is hotter than the sun&#39;s surface. It takes 165 earth years for one year on Neptune. Neptune has 4 rings. Neptune also has 8 known moons. Neptune has winds that blow at about 1,200 miles per hour.
  Neptune was discovered by mathematical calculations. Neptune is a stormy planet!
</p>
<h2>Dwarf Planets</h2>
<p>
Pluto is the second largest and most famous dwarf planet. Pluto is reddish-colored. Pluto has one moon, called Charon. Because Charon is so big, Pluto and Charon are
considered a double-planet link. Pluto also has 4 smaller moons- Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. One day on Pluto is 6 days on Earth. One year on Pluto is 248 years on Earth. If I lived on Pluto, my birthday would come only once every 248 Earth years.
I personally would not like that!
</p>
<p>
  Eris is the biggest dwarf planet. Eris is also the coldest and most distant dwarf planet. It is gray, unlike other dwarf planets.
  Eris is made from 1 third rock and 2 thirds ice. I can’t imagine how cold it would be over there!
</p>
<p>
When reddish colored Makemake, the third biggest dwarf planet, was discovered it was called ‘Easter bunny’, because it was found around Easter time.
Makemake is made of ice. I wonder if Makemake is the smallest dwarf planet. It takes 310 earth years for Makemake to make one complete orbit around our Sun.
That means 310 earth years for one year on Makemake. 
</p>
<p>
  Hauma is one of the strangest objects in the solar system. It is a dwarf planet shaped like a football. When it is orbiting the sun, it goes end over end like a football in the field.
  Scientists call it the cosmic football. Hauma is like an M&M. The outside candy coating is the ice. The chocolate inside is the rock. Hauma is a very bizarre dwarf planet.

<h2>Asteroids, Comets, and Meteors</h2>
<p>The difference between meteors, meteoroids, and meteorites;  A meteoroid is a small part from an asteroid or a comet that is orbiting the Sun.
A meteor is what a meteoroid is called when it burns up in the Earths atmosphere, and it is also known as a shooting star. A meteorite is a meteoroid that
makes it&#39;s journey through the Earths atmosphere and hits the Earths surface. That is the difference between meteors, meteoroids, and meteorites.
</p>
<p>
The difference between meteors, meteoroids, meteorites, comets, and asteroids is that asteroids are made of various
metals and rocky material, while comets are made of ice, dust and rocky material. Meteoroids, meteors, and meteorites are parts of asteroids and comets.
Asteroids, comets, meteors, meteoroids, and meteorites are all different, interesting space objects.
</p>
<p>
Meteoroids are mostly made of rock. 10% are made of iron and nickel. Did you know Earth gains almost a ton of weight from meteor dust
 everyday? Wow! The Earth must be heavy!
</p>
<p>
      Comets have several parts. The nucleus is the main solid part of a comet. It is often one to ten kilometers in diameter, but can also be 100 kilometers.
      The coma is a circle of dust evaporated gas such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and more. The nucleus and the coma together make the head of the comet.
      Surrounding the coma is the hydrogen envelope, which is an invisible layer of clouds. The dust tail is made from dust and always points away from the sun. The ion tail is made
      from electrically charged gas molecules. Those are the parts of a comet.
</p>
<p>
	Asteroids are rocks orbiting the sun. They can be called space rocks, because that is exactly what they are! Big asteroids can be called planetoids.
      Asteroids are more common than comets. Thousands of asteroids are discovered every year. I wonder if a planetoid has ever hit Earth?
</p>
<p> 
  The Solar System is amazing. There are lot’s of unknown things in our Solar System, and astronauts hope to find them. However, our Solar System is only one
  small Solar System in the galaxy. I wonder what else is out there?
